# Web UI Examples
This folder contains walk-through examples (with screenshots) of how to use the online [Citrination UI](https://citrination.com/). The numbering corresponds to a suggested order for someone accessing Citrination for their first time.

Each file also addresses a separate functionality of the UI, so you can just learn about the functionality you need.

To see an example workflow that combines many of these elements, check out the [demo on shape memory alloys](JournalPaperToModel.ipynb).

After you've explored the web UI, we encourage you to also check out the Citrination application program interface (API) which allows you to interact with your data and models through Python scripts. Tutorials can be found in the [citrination_api_examples](../citrination_api_examples/) folder.
