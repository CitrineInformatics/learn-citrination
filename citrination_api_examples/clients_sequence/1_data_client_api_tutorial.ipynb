    "In this notebook, we will cover how to use the [Citrination API](http://citrineinformatics.github.io/python-citrination-client/) to upload and manage datasets on Citrination. Getting your data on Citrination will allow you to keep your data organized in one place and enable you to perform machine learning (ML) on the data. The application program interface (API) aims to facilitate the process for those who prefer writing Python scripts and wish to avoid the web user interface (UI). As a sanity check, however, it might be helpful for you to keep the UI open and follow along with the tutorial to verify the changes are what you expect."

Copy this key to your clipboard.\n",
